    <h2>Difference between Local storage and Session storage</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>LocalStorage:</strong> Web storage can be viewed simplistically as
      an improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage capacity.
      Available size is 5MB which considerably more space to work with than a
      typical 4KB cookie. The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP
      request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) - reducing the amount of
      traffic between client and server. The data stored in localStorage
      persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available
      for all current and future visits to the site​ <br /><strong
        >sessionStorage:</strong
      >
      It is similar to localStorage. Changes are only available per window (or
      tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox). Changes made are saved and
      available for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on
      the same window. Once the window is closed, the storage is deleted The
      data is available only inside the window/tab in which it was set​

    <h2>What is the difference between Global Scope and Local Scope</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Global Variables:</strong> A global variable has a global scope
      which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.<br />

      <strong>Local Variables:</strong> A local variable will be visible only
      within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always
      local to that function.
    </p>
    <h2>How do work Event loop in javascript</h2>
    <p>
      When any Asynchronous event occur such as setTimeOut or promises... Then
      these task takes some time to complete I/O if they have any. If they
      completed their I/O or don't have any, then they simply put into message
      queue or callback queue. Then event loop will firstly execute the call
      stack tasks and then look for callback or message queue and then execute
      it.
    </p>
    <h2>How we will get Undefined from javascript</h2>
    <p>
      We will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or
      method of an object. In the above example, a function Sum does not return
      any result but still we try to assign its resulted value to a variable. So
      in this case, result will be undefined.
