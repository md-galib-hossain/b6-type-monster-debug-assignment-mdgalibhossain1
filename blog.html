    <h2>Difference between Local storage and Session storage</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>LocalStorage:</strong> Web storage can be viewed simplistically as
      an improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage capacity.
      Available size is 5MB which considerably more space to work with than a
      typical 4KB cookie. The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP
      request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) - reducing the amount of
      traffic between client and server. The data stored in localStorage
      persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available
      for all current and future visits to the site​ <br /><strong
        >sessionStorage:</strong
      >
      It is similar to localStorage. Changes are only available per window (or
      tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox). Changes made are saved and
      available for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on
      the same window. Once the window is closed, the storage is deleted The
      data is available only inside the window/tab in which it was set​
